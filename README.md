# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project (Backend)

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a backend-driven web application built to replicate the core features of Airbnb.  
It allows users to create accounts, list properties, make bookings, process payments, and leave reviews — all through a secure and scalable RESTful API.

This project emphasizes **API design, data modeling, and backend logic**, ensuring a solid foundation for frontend integration.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop a **robust backend** that supports user registration, property listings, bookings, and reviews.  
- Implement **secure authentication** and **payment handling**.  
- Create **RESTful and GraphQL APIs** for flexible client communication.  
- Ensure high performance and reliability through **database optimization** and **asynchronous processing**.  
- Follow modern **DevOps practices** for deployment and CI/CD.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

| **Technology** | **Purpose in the Project** |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Django** | A powerful Python web framework used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs for the project. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | Simplifies the creation and management of RESTful API endpoints, handling authentication, serialization, and permissions. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A robust relational database used to store user, property, booking, and payment data securely. |
| **GraphQL** | Provides a flexible and efficient way to query and interact with backend data, reducing multiple API calls. |
| **Celery** | Handles asynchronous background tasks, such as sending confirmation emails and processing payments. |
| **Redis** | Used for caching and session management to speed up data retrieval and improve performance. |
| **Docker** | Containerizes the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment across different environments. |
| **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)** | Automates testing and deployment workflows, ensuring code quality and continuous integration. |
